A Lens is a component of glass or transparent plastic material, usually circular, with two primary surfaces that are ground and polished in a specific manner designed to produce either a convergence or divergence of light passing through the material. An Instrument may have several Lenses with different functions, such as a Magnification Changer (also known as Optovar), a Coupling Lens connecting the Light Source with the Microscope Stand, a Relay Lens positioned at the Detector mount, or additional Lenses placed in the Light Path for various purposes. This element can be associated with an optional Optics Turret.",
