This check is necessary because often NA regulation in these types of Objectives occurs via a rotating collar whose exact position is difficult to measure and reproduce across different Experiments.

Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh Sect. A, 25:181; Shannon C.E., (1949) Proc. IRE, 37:10). The Nyquist Criterion determines the minimal Sampling Density needed to capture ALL information from the Specimen into the Image. It can be shown that if the Sampling Density is higher than the Nyquist Rate (also referred to as Critical Sampling Distance) all information about the object is captured. It is important to note that the Nyquist Rate depends on the Objective Numerical Aperture (NA) and on the Excitation and Emission WaveLengths. The recommended Nyquist Rate is &gt; 2 for conventional light microscopy, and it is 2.5 - 3 for high resolution imaging.",
