	"description":"A Photomultiplier Tube (PMT) is a photoemissive device in which the absorption of a photon results in the emission of an electron and it is used for the detection of very weak signals. These Detectors work by amplifying the electrons generated by a photocathode exposed to a photon flux. The higher the supplied voltage (PMTVoltage setting), the greater the amplification of the current (PMTGain setting) and thus sensitivity, but also the higher the noise in the acquired image. The amplifier offset (PMTOffset setting) defines black level setting of the image. A PMT has no inherent spatial information of the image.",
