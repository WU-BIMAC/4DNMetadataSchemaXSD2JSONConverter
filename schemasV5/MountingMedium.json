According to ISO 10934-1:2002, a Mounting Medium is a liquid, synthetic resin or other medium in which this Specimen is placed during Image Acquisition. NOTE For fixed Samples observed by transmitted-light microscopy, this Medium is transparent, colourless and of specified refractive index, enclosed between the slide and the cover glass. For reflected-light microscopy, the mounting medium is normally a resin with which the Sample is impregnated so that a polished section may be made. For live Samples, the Medium is typically the tissue culture growth substrate.",
