The aperture and angle of the light cone must be adjusted (via the size of the Diaphragm) for each different Objective.",

According to ISO 10934-1:2002, options include: 1) Abbe, this is a condenser of simple design introduced by Abbe, in which there is only limited correction for spherical aberration and none for chromatic aberration. 2) Achromatic-aplanatic, this is a in which chromatic aberrations and spherical aberrations have been reduced. 3) Cardioid, this is a dark field condenser for transmitted light illumination that has spherical aberration and coma (i.e., aberration in which the image of an off-axis point object is deformed so that the image is shaped like a comet) correction. 4) Dark-field, this is a dark-ground condenser designed for dark-field microscopy, which for reflected-light microscopy might be located within the mount of the objective. 5) Pancratic, this is a condenser containing a variable “zoom” (pancratic) lens which allows the size of the illuminated field at the object to be varied while the illuminated field diaphragm remains of constant size. 6) Phase-contrast, this is condenser designed for phasecontrast microscopy. 6) Universal, this is a condenser designed for multiple contrast methods such as bright field, dark field, phase contrast, differential interference contrast, polarized light and modulation contrast.",
