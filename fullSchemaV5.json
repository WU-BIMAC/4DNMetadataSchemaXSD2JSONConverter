NOTE: In the case of Point Detectors the value of Analog Gain can be set freely by the user. Conversely, in the case of Cameras, it is common for the Gain to be preset by the Manufacturer to minimize noise. In this case, either the Analog Gain cannot be changed or the user is given the choice of selecting between a few preset Analog Gains values upon Acquisition. Finally, several Cameras might have so-called Automatic Gain Control (AGC or AutoGain) that will automatically adjusts so the full range of the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) is used.

Examples include: 1) the Electron Multiplication (EM) gain (as opposed to the inherent Analog Gain) for an EMCCD camera. 2) The Gain introduced by the Micro-Channel Plate in an Intensified CCD or CMOS camera. 3) The amplification of the electron current provided by a Photomultiplier Tube, and measured as the ratio of the input photoelectron current emitted by the photocatode and the current reaching the anode. 4) The signal amplification provided by an Avalache Photo Diode (APD).",

			"description":"This field describes the general category to which this Microscope belongs. A Compound Microscope is a Microscope in which the primary image is generated by an objective or an objective and a tube-lens, and in which the Sample is observed through an eyepiece. A Custom Microscope is specially designed for specialized purposes. An Electrophysiology Microscope is a Microscope dedicated to electrophysiological observation and manipulation. A Lightsheet Microscope is a Microscope in which in contrast to epifluorescence microscopy only a thin slice (usually a few hundred nanometers to a few micrometers) of the sample is illuminated perpendicularly to the direction of observation. A Stereo Microscope (also known as Dissecting Microscope) is a low-power, binocular Microscope with long free working distance used for dissecting. Generally in this type of Microscope the object is observed by each eye from a slightly different angle, thus causing stereoscopic perception.",

NOTE: In the case of Point Detectors the value of Analog Gain can be set freely by the user. Conversely, in the case of Cameras, it is common for the Gain to be preset by the Manufacturer to minimize noise. In this case, either the Analog Gain cannot be changed or the user is given the choice of selecting between a few preset Analog Gains values upon Acquisition. Finally, several Cameras might have so-called Automatic Gain Control (AGC or AutoGain) that will automatically adjusts so the full range of the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) is used.

A Lens is a component of glass or transparent plastic material, usually circular, with two primary surfaces that are ground and polished in a specific manner designed to produce either a convergence or divergence of light passing through the material. An Instrument may have several Lenses with different functions, such as a Magnification Changer (also known as Optovar), a Coupling Lens connecting the Light Source with the Microscope Stand, a Relay Lens positioned at the Detector mount, or additional Lenses placed in the Light Path for various purposes. This element can be associated with an optional Optics Turret.",

			"description":"This field describes the general category to which this Microscope belongs. A Compound Microscope is a Microscope in which the primary image is generated by an objective or an objective and a tube-lens, and in which the Sample is observed through an eyepiece. A Custom Microscope is specially designed for specialized purposes. An Electrophysiology Microscope is a Microscope dedicated to electrophysiological observation and manipulation. A Lightsheet Microscope is a Microscope in which in contrast to epifluorescence microscopy only a thin slice (usually a few hundred nanometers to a few micrometers) of the sample is illuminated perpendicularly to the direction of observation. A Stereo Microscope (also known as Dissecting Microscope) is a low-power, binocular Microscope with long free working distance used for dissecting. Generally in this type of Microscope the object is observed by each eye from a slightly different angle, thus causing stereoscopic perception.",
