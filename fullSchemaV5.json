NOTE: In the case of Point Detectors the value of Analog Gain can be set freely by the user. Conversely, in the case of Cameras, it is common for the Gain to be preset by the Manufacturer to minimize noise. In this case, either the Analog Gain cannot be changed or the user is given the choice of selecting between a few preset Analog Gains values upon Acquisition. Finally, several Cameras might have so-called Automatic Gain Control (AGC or AutoGain) that will automatically adjusts so the full range of the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) is used.

Examples include: 1) the Electron Multiplication (EM) gain (as opposed to the inherent Analog Gain) for an EMCCD camera. 2) The Gain introduced by the Micro-Channel Plate in an Intensified CCD or CMOS camera. 3) The amplification of the electron current provided by a Photomultiplier Tube, and measured as the ratio of the input photoelectron current emitted by the photocatode and the current reaching the anode. 4) The signal amplification provided by an Avalache Photo Diode (APD).",

A Compound Microscope is a Microscope in which the primary image is generated by an objective or an objective and a tube-lens, and in which the Sample is observed through an eyepiece. A Custom Microscope is specially designed for specialized purposes. An Electrophysiology Microscope is a Microscope dedicated to electrophysiological observation and manipulation. A Lightsheet Microscope is a Microscope in which in contrast to epifluorescence microscopy only a thin slice (usually a few hundred nanometers to a few micrometers) of the sample is illuminated perpendicularly to the direction of observation. A Stereo Microscope (also known as Dissecting Microscope) is a low-power, binocular Microscope with long free working distance used for dissecting. Generally in this type of Microscope the object is observed by each eye from a slightly different angle, thus causing stereoscopic perception.",

NOTE: In the case of Point Detectors the value of Analog Gain can be set freely by the user. Conversely, in the case of Cameras, it is common for the Gain to be preset by the Manufacturer to minimize noise. In this case, either the Analog Gain cannot be changed or the user is given the choice of selecting between a few preset Analog Gains values upon Acquisition. Finally, several Cameras might have so-called Automatic Gain Control (AGC or AutoGain) that will automatically adjusts so the full range of the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) is used.

Refer to ISO 8036-1 for more details on Immersion Oil. Please NOTE: Because the Immersion Liquid is considered in the computing of corrections to be part of the lens, its refractive index and dispersion (or Abbe number) are critical. Also please NOTE: In case a Cover Glass is not used during Acquisition the Immersion Liquid is most often referred to as Dipping Medium. Examples of Dipping Media include, water-based solutions (biological buffers, culture media, other water-based solutions) and organic-based [FocusClear (CLARITY); CUBIC-1, CUBIC-2, CUBIC-R1, CUBIC-R2; 2,2-thiodiethanol (TDE); ethyl cinnamate; Benzyl Benzoate and BB-PEG (PEGASOS); Benzyl Alcohol, Benzyl Benzoate (BABB); dibenzyl ether (DBE); Ethanol]."

A Compound Microscope is a Microscope in which the primary image is generated by an objective or an objective and a tube-lens, and in which the Sample is observed through an eyepiece. A Custom Microscope is specially designed for specialized purposes. An Electrophysiology Microscope is a Microscope dedicated to electrophysiological observation and manipulation. A Lightsheet Microscope is a Microscope in which in contrast to epifluorescence microscopy only a thin slice (usually a few hundred nanometers to a few micrometers) of the sample is illuminated perpendicularly to the direction of observation. A Stereo Microscope (also known as Dissecting Microscope) is a low-power, binocular Microscope with long free working distance used for dissecting. Generally in this type of Microscope the object is observed by each eye from a slightly different angle, thus causing stereoscopic perception.",
