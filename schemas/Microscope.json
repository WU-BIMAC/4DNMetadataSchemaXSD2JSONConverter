It is primarily a container referring to the microscope's components list, which include the Microscope Body, Microscope Table, LightSource, LightSourceCoupling, SampleHolder, Focusing devices, Objective, Optovar, Filter, Dichroic, AdditionalOptics, Detector and CalibrationTool. The Filter element can be composed either of separate excitation, emission filters and a dichroic mirror or a single filter set. Within the Image itself, a reference is made to this one Filter element. There may be multiple light sources, detectors, objectives and filters etc. in an Instrument. Each of these has their own ID attribute, which can be referred to from Channel. It is understood that the light path configuration can be different for each channel, but cannot be different for each timepoint or each plane of an XYZ stack.",
