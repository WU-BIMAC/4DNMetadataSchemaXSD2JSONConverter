To compensate for this error, the more highly corrected objectives are equipped with a correction collar to allow adjustment of the central lens group position to coincide with fluctuations in cover glass thickness. The CorrectionCollar is normally an adjustable ring on the objective, whose position can be modified. This field records the position of the collar during the acquisition of this image. Each correction collar has an arbitrary scale on it so the values is unit-less.",
