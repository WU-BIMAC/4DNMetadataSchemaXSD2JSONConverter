The values are those that are fixed for a particular objective: either because it has been manufactured to this specification or the value has been measured on this particular objective. Correction: This is the type of correction coating applied to this lens. Immersion: This is the types of immersion medium the lens is designed to work with. It is not the same as 'Medium' in ObjectiveRef (a single type) as here Immersion can have compound values like 'Multi'. LensNA: The numerical aperture of the lens (as a float) NominalMagnification: The specified magnification e.g. x10 CalibratedMagnification: The measured magnification e.g. x10.3 WorkingDistance: WorkingDistance of the lens",
